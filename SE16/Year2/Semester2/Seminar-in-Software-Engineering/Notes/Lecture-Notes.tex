\chapter{Lecture 1: Intelligent Agent}

\section{What are agents in AI?}

An agent is anything that can be viewed as \textbf{perceiving} its environment through \textbf{sensors} and \textbf{acting} upon that environment through \textbf{actuators}

Example of agents in human body: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin

Agent can have actions, e.g. Vacuum cleaner $\rightarrow$ Agent: Detect dirty space, Action: Clean

Type of Agents:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rule based Agent
    \item Logic based Agent
\end{itemize}

\subsection{An Agent as a Logical System}

Any logical system consists of a knowledge base \& inference engine.

Example of Intelligent Agents in real world application:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Traffic-Light Control
    \item Smart Meter
    \item Smart Home
    \item Smart Factory (SCADA)
\end{itemize}

\section{Agents for Traffic-Light Control}

Rule 1: IF (current\_state(P) \land state\_counter(N) \land N $\le$ 0)
