\section*{Requirements}

\subsection*{User Requirements}

\subsubsection*{Functional}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The software shall allow users to create, view, edit and
        delete desired projects.
    \item The software shall allow users to create tasks, assign them
        to team members and set deadlines.
    \item The software shall allow users to update their task status
        such as in progress, completed, etc.
    \item The software shall allow users to view project timeline in
        a Gantt Chart and draw diagrams in canvas.
    \item The software shall allow users to collaborate and receive
        notifications for task update.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Non-Functional}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The application shall save the diagrams into \texttt{SVG} or
        \texttt{PNG} format and paste into any kind of document file.
    \item The system shall be accessible through modern web browsers
        without requiring additional plugins.
    \item The user interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate
        for both managers and team members for collaborative actions,
        including modifications of the charts and diagrams.
    \item The system shall ensure data consistency and prevent unauthorized
        access to project data.
    \item The application shall maintain availability during concurrent
        usage by multiple users.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{System Requirements}

\subsubsection*{Functional}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The system shall support storage and retrieval of project
        metadata and design artifacts (e.g., diagrams, timelines)
        using \texttt{JSON} fields in PostgreSQL.
    \item The system shall log application errors, security events,
        and system activity using Django’s logging framework for
        monitoring and debugging.
    \item The system shall provide a frontend implemented using React
        with TypeScript, enabling dynamic rendering of project boards,
        tasks, and project views without full page reloads.
    \item The system shall expose RESTful APIs implemented using Django
        and Django REST Framework (DRF) to handle user authentication,
        project management, task assignment, and metadata retrieval.
    \item The system shall support real-time communication using Django
        Channels and WebSockets, allowing instant synchronization of
        task updates, assignments, mentions, and notifications across
        connected clients.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Non-Functional}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The system shall maintain low-latency real-time updates, with
        WebSocket message propagation handled via Django Channels backed
        by Redis as a message broker.
    \item The system shall secure all client-server communication using
        \texttt{HTTPS} and secure WebSocket protocols, with reverse proxy
        support provided by Nginx.
    \item The system shall be scalable to support multiple concurrent
        users by utilizing ASGI servers (e.g., Uvicorn/Daphne) and
        stateless backend services.
    \item The system shall ensure data integrity and transactional
        consistency through PostgreSQL ACID-compliant transactions.
    \item The Database shall be normalized to the fifth normal form
        (5NF) to prevent the \texttt{INSERT} and \texttt{DELETE} problem
        in the relational database.
\end{itemize}
